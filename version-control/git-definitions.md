# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is managing changes to source code over time. It is useful because it allows developers to go back to earlier versions to help fix mistakes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a movable pointer to multiple commits in git object data. Using separate branches other than master allows a good workflow for a team to work progressively together with less interference with one another.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message should be relevant to the changes made and should be in present tense.

* What is a merge conflict?
If the same lines in the same file were changed by different people, or if a line was modified by one person or deleted by another person, git is not able to know which is correct.

small change to file :)
