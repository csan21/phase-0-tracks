RELEASE 4: REFLECT

1. Semantic tags make lines of code easier to read and distinguish.
I find the header, main, and section tags very useful, personally.

2. The html is loaded first, from top to bottom.

3. The snippet tool is a good shortcut for laying a base for multiple pages. 
I will definitely be using it later on.

4. I was still having a bit of trouble of where to place semantic elements.
My GPS instructor put into terms that made more sense to me and helped tremendously.
I think I will get better and more comfortable as I continue on with challenges.
